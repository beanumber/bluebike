# bluebike R package

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The `bluebike` R package contains data from [Blue Bikes System Data](https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data) website. It contains monthly trip data from Feb. 2022.

The data includes:

-   The name and geographic location of the bike stations
-   Start and end time of the trip
-   Trip duration
-   Bike id
-   Basic user information

Additionally, the data includes a random sample of 1000 trip history entries for sample analysis and functions for importation of the full data set.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bluebike from [GitHub](https://github.com/zyang2k/bluebike) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zyang2k/bluebike")
```

## Sample Data Set

-   `trip_history_sample`: a sample of 1000 trip data entries from February 2022.

## Basic Usage

### Data Wrangling

Count the number of trips from starting stations:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(bluebike)
library(dplyr)

stations <- trip_history_sample %>% 
  group_by(`start station name`) %>% 
  summarize(trips_from = n())
head(stations)
```

### Data Visualization via Leaflet

Display the position of the starting stations:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval= FALSE}
library(leaflet)

BostonMap <- leaflet(data = trip_history_sample) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = trip_history_sample$`start station longitude`, 
                   lat = trip_history_sample$`start station latitude`, 
                   radius = 0.1, 
                   color = "blue")

BostonMap
```
